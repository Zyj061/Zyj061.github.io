    <p> I'm currently working between PKU and UCL, where I explore the exciting field of 
    <strong>brain-inspired computing</strong> üß†ü§ñ ‚Äî from neural coding and perception to neuromorphic systems and high-speed sensing.
    I'm particularly interested in building intelligent systems that take inspiration from how the brain sees and acts. </p>
  
    <p> I've led several projects related to 
    <strong>neuromorphic cameras</strong> and <strong> spike-based visual computing </strong> üé•‚ö°Ô∏è.
    I'm very lucky to be mentored by 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=knvEK4AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof. Tiejun Huang</a> and 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q_4u0aoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof. Karl Friston</a>, 
    whose guidance continues to shape my thinkingüí°. 
    </p>
    
    <p> I also serve as a reviewer for conferences and journals such as <em>ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS/ICCV/ECCV/CVPR/TIP</em> and 
    <em>Neural Networks</em>. I'm always open to chatting and collaborating on related topics. 
    Feel free to reach out if you're working in this space ‚Äî would love to connect! ü§ù 
    </p>
