    <h2>SpikeCV⚡️</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
     I'm leading <strong>SpikeCV</strong>, an open-source project designed for the emerging field of <em>spike camera</em> vision.  
     It brings together spiking datasets, reusable algorithms, and hardware interfaces — everything you need to explore fast, brain-inspired vision.  
     The goal is to build a community around spike-based computing and help researchers get from simulation to real-world deployment.

        We are actively growing the SpikeCV community, aiming to bring together researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts working on spike-based vision systems.
        We’d love to have you on board if you’re interested — feel free to reach out and join us! ✨
